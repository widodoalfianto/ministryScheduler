# 📅 ministryScheduler

This repository contains the Google Apps Script and Google Sheets logic used for **monthly ministry scheduling**.

The script is currently configured to:
- **Create a new availability form and schedule sheet** on the **8th day of every month**
- Triggered automatically by a **time-based Apps Script trigger**

---

## 🚀 Improvements Roadmap

We welcome contributions! If you're interested in helping improve this project, here are some ideas currently on the roadmap:

1. ✅ **Email alerts when Apps Script encounters errors**
2. ✨ **Enhance the current availability sheet with:**
   - Dropdowns for member names
   - Warnings when the number of assignments exceeds willingness
3. 📧 **Email notifications to ministers**
   - Including their personal schedule and the full monthly schedule
4. 🧹 **Code clean-up and refactoring**
5. 🔁 **Integrate a CI/CD pipeline** for version control and deployment
